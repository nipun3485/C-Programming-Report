# C Programming Lab – Complete README (Experiments 01–09)

This repository contains all experiments performed as part of the C Programming Laboratory.
Each experiment is organized into a separate folder and contains:

- C source code (.c files)
- Screenshots of execution
- A short explanation of logic

## Experiment 01 – Getting Started with C

Tasks:
1. Print “Hello World”.
2. Print an address in multiple lines.
3. Input name and age from user and display them.
4. Input two numbers and print their sum.

## Experiment 02 – Operators

Tasks:
1. Compute the area and perimeter of a rectangle using length and width.
2. Convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula: F = (C × 9/5) + 32.

## Experiment 03.1 – Conditional Statements

Tasks:
1. Check if a triangle is valid. If valid, determine whether it is isosceles, equilateral, right-angled, or scalene.
2. Compute the BMI of a person and classify the BMI value.
3. Check if three points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) are collinear.
4. Assume 01/01/01 was Monday. For any input year, determine the day on 1st January of that year.
5. Using the ternary operator, find which rectangle out of three has the highest perimeter.

## Experiment 03.2 – Loops

Tasks:
1. Continuously accept numbers until the user stops. Count positive, negative, and zero values.
2. Print the multiplication table of a user-entered number.
3. Pattern printing:
   a.
      1
      2 3
      4 5 6
   b.
      1
      1 1
      1 2 1
      1 3 3 1
4. Calculate population growth for 10 years starting with 100000 and 10% annual growth.
5. Print all Ramanujan numbers up to a reasonable limit.

## Experiment 04 – Variables and Scope

Tasks:
1. Declare a global variable and use it across functions.
2. Declare a local variable inside a function and test accessibility.
3. Declare variables inside different code blocks and test scope.
4. Demonstrate the behavior of static variables across function calls.

---

## Experiment 05 – Arrays

Tasks:
1. Read integers into an array and print the second largest value.
2. Count positive, negative, odd, and even values in an array.
3. Count the frequency of any input number in the array.
4. Read two matrices and perform matrix multiplication after checking compatibility.

---

## Experiment 06 – Functions

Tasks:
1. Recursive and non-recursive factorial; compute binomial coefficients.
2. Compute GCD using recursion.
3. Generate Fibonacci series using recursion.
4. Define a function ISPRIME(num) and print all primes in a range.
5. Define a function REVERSE(str) to reverse a string.

---

## Experiment 07 – Structures and Union

Tasks:
1. Use a structure to add and subtract complex numbers.
2. Use a structure to compute the monthly salary of an employee.
3. Pass a structure variable (Book) as a function argument.
4. Use a union to display the current address.

---

## Experiment 08 – Pointers

Tasks:
1. Declare pointers of different types and print values.
2. Perform pointer arithmetic operations.
3. Pass variables by reference to functions using pointers.

---

## Experiment 09 – File Handling

Tasks:
1. Create a file and write text into it.
2. Read an existing file character by character.
3. Read a file line by line.
