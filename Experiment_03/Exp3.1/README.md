# Experiment 3.1 – Conditional Statements

## Objective
To understand and implement conditional statements in C using if–else, nested if, and logical operators.  
This experiment covers decision-making programs based on user input.

## Task 1 – Check if Triangle is Valid and Identify Type

### Aim:
Write a C program to:
1. Check if the triangle is valid using triangle inequality rule.
2. If valid, identify if the triangle is:
   - Equilateral
   - Isosceles
   - Scalene
   - Right-angled

## Task 2 – Compute BMI Index with Category

### Aim:
Write a program to compute BMI using:

Then classify the BMI using the table provided:
- Starvation: < 15  
- Anorexic: 15.1 – 17.5  
- Underweight: 17.6 – 18.5  
- Ideal: 18.6 – 24.9  
- Overweight: 25 – 25.9  
- Obese: 30 – 39.9  
- Morbidly Obese: 40+

## Task 3 – Check if Three Points Are Collinear

### Aim:
Write a program to input three points (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3) and check if they lie on a single straight line.

## Task 4 – Find Day on 1st January of Any Year (Gregorian Calendar)

### Aim:
If 1/1/01 was Monday, write a program that takes any year as input and prints which day of the week is 1st January of that year.

## Task 5 – Ternary Operator: Highest Perimeter Rectangle

### Aim:
Using ternary operator:
- Take three rectangles (length & breadth of each)
- Compute the perimeter of each  
- Identify which rectangle has the highest perimeter

## Conclusion
This experiment enhanced understanding of conditional statements, nested decisions, logical operators, and mathematical reasoning in C.  
These concepts form the foundation for real-world decision-making programs.
