# Experiment 3.2 – Loops

## Objective
To understand the concept of loops (for, while, do–while) in C and implement them to solve iterative problems.

## Task 1 – Count Positive, Negative and Zero Values

### Aim:
Write a C program that continuously accepts numbers from the user until the user chooses to stop.  
At the end, display:
- Count of positive numbers  
- Count of negative numbers  
- Count of zero values  

---

## Task 2 – Multiplication Table

### Aim:
Write a C program that prints the multiplication table of any number entered by the user.  
Display it in the format:

---

## Task 3 – Pattern Printing

### (a) Pattern:
1
2 3
4 5 6


### (b) Pattern:
1
1 1
1 2 1
1 3 3 1

(This is Pascal’s Triangle – first 4 rows)

## Task 4 – Population Growth

### Aim:
Initial population = 100000  
Growth rate = 10% per year  
Find population at the end of each year for 10 years.

---

## Task 5 – Ramanujan Numbers

### Aim:
A Ramanujan number is a number that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.  
Example:  
1729 = 12³ + 1³ = 10³ + 9³

Write a program to print all such numbers up to a reasonable limit (e.g., 5000).

## Conclusion
In this experiment, we learned how loops help perform repetitive tasks efficiently.  
We implemented while-loops, for-loops, nested loops, and used loops for mathematical and pattern-based programs.
