# Experiment 01 – Basic C Programming

## Objective
To understand the basics of C programming including printing output, using escape sequences, accepting user input, and performing simple arithmetic operations.

## Tasks Performed

### **Task 1 – Print “Hello World”**
**Aim:**  
To write a C program that prints “Hello World” on the screen.

**Concept Used:**  
`printf()` function from the stdio.h library.

---

### **Task 2 – Print Address in New Line**
**Aim:**  
To print a sample address with each part displayed on a new line.

**Concept Used:**  
Escape sequence `\n` for new line.

---

### **Task 3 – Take Name and Age From User**
**Aim:**  
To accept user input for name and age and then display them.

**Concepts Used:**  
- `scanf()` to take input  
- `%s`, `%d` format specifiers  
- Variables and data types

---

### **Task 4 – Take Two Numbers and Print Their Sum**
**Aim:**  
To accept two integers from the user and display their sum.

**Concepts Used:**  
- Integer variables  
- User input using `scanf()`  
- Arithmetic operator `+`

## Conclusion
In this experiment, we learned the fundamentals of C programming including printing text, using escape sequences, reading user input, and performing simple arithmetic operations. These basic concepts form the foundation for writing more complex C programs.
